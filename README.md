### Features

- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and classification of facial emotions.
- Trained on a diverse dataset including facial expressions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted, fearful, and neutral.
- Transfer learning approach for efficient model training by leveraging pre-trained models for feature extraction and fine-tuning with the provided dataset.
- Real-time facial expression detection and classification using the webcam interface within the GUI.
- Display of detected emotion as a text label on the graphical user interface.

### Applications

The Facial Emotion Recognition system has potential applications in various domains:

1. Healthcare: The system can assist in detecting and diagnosing mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety by analyzing facial expressions. It can provide valuable insights for mental health professionals and aid in personalized treatment planning.

2. Education: In educational settings, the system can analyze the emotional states of students during learning activities. This information can be used to evaluate engagement, monitor attention levels, and provide personalized feedback to enhance the learning process.

3. Entertainment: The system can be utilized in game development, virtual reality experiences, and animation. It can enhance user experiences by enabling interactive and immersive environments that respond to the user's facial expressions, creating a more engaging and realistic interaction.

### Requirements and Dependencies

To run the Facial Emotion Recognition system, the following prerequisites are necessary:

- Python 3.x
